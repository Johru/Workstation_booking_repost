# Workstation Booking Full-Stack project

This was a fullstack school project for five students and a mentor and approximately four weeks of work. A simple web application to allow employees to book a specific seats in their office. 
Users can make an account and log in, select buildings, floors and workstations and make reservations for a specific day and seat. They can display the list of all reservations they made and delete them.
Admins additionally have the ability to promote, demote or remove users, and create or edit buildings, floors and workstations.


## My contribution

Though I worked on the UI, database design and wireframes and later on helped out with frontend, the bulk of my contribution was on the backend, primarily all of the user, reservation and building endpoints.

- `frontend`: Angular,Typescript, JWT, RxJS
- `backend`: Express.js, Node.js, TypeORM, mySQL, 0Auth, Bcrypt
